# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Notificapp. An ADR captures one significant architectural decision: the context that forced it, the decision itself, and its consequences — so future contributors (human or AI) understand *why* the code is shaped the way it is, not just *how*.

## Statuses

- **Accepted** — the decision stands and the code follows it (or the ADR notes known violations explicitly)
- **Proposed** — under consideration; the ADR records the options and the criteria/trigger for deciding
- **Superseded by ADR-XXX** — replaced by a later decision (keep the file; history matters)

## Adding a new ADR

1. Copy the structure of an existing ADR: `# ADR NNN – Title`, then `## Status`, `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences` (with **Positive** and **Negative** — every decision has costs; write them down)
2. Number it sequentially (`013-...`), use a kebab-case filename
3. Add a row to the index table above
4. Reference it from code/docs where the decision applies (e.g., `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, KDoc comments)

Write an ADR when a decision is expensive to reverse, constrains future work, or will make someone ask "why is it done this way?" — not for routine implementation choices.
